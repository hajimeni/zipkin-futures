# Zipkin-futures [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lloydmeta/zipkin-futures.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lloydmeta/zipkin-futures) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/lloydmeta/zipkin-futures/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/lloydmeta/zipkin-futures)

Hopefully provides a nice way to use Scala `Future`s with Zipkin tracing.

ATM mostly a wrapper around Brave, but can be extended to use other Zipkin libs by extending `ZipkinServiceLike`.

Also, mostly meant to be used with Play2.

## SBT

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
    "com.beachape" %% "zipkin-futures" % "0.0.2"  // OR
    "com.beachape" %% "zipkin-futures-play" % "0.0.2" // if you are using Play and want to use the filter w/ RequestHeader conversions
)
```

If the above does not work because it cannot be resolved, its likely because it hasn't been synced to Maven central yet.
In that case, download a SNAPSHOT release of the same version by adding this to build.sbt

```scala
resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
    "com.beachape" %% "zipkin-futures" % "0.0.2-SNAPSHOT" // OR
    "com.beachape" %% "zipkin-futures-play" % "0.0.2-SNAPSHOT" // if you are using Play and want to use the filter w/ RequestHeader conversions
)
```

## Example

An example of how this can be used within a Play 2 app. *Note* Use without a Play app is possible, but you will need to figure
out how to provide an implicit `Span` to the trace function.

In `Global.scala` add a filter that looks for Zipkin headers in the incoming request if they're there, sends Spans to
 Zipkin with ServerReceived and ServerSent annotations once a result has come back up the set of filters, and
 injects Zipkin headers into the incoming request for other filters and controller actions.

```scala
object Global
  extends WithFilters(ZipkinHeaderFilter(new BraveZipkinService("localhost", 123, "testing-filter", collector)))
  with GlobalSettings
```

In your controllers or action filters, (e.g. in Application.scala), import the `RequestHeader` to `Span` converter and
the enrichment to `Future`.

```scala
import com.beachape.zipkin.Implicits._
import com.beachape.zipkin.FutureEnrichments._

class Application(implicit zipkinService: ZipkinServiceLike) extends Controller {

  import play.api.libs.concurrent.Execution.Implicits._

  def index = Action.async { implicit req =>
    // The following will be traced
    Future { Ok(expensiveResult) } trace ("expensive-process")
  }

}
```
