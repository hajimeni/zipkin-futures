  /**
   * The simplest kind synchronous tracing; traces the provided operation `f` using the provided traceName and annotations.
   *
   * This function expects that there is a parent [[Span]] in scope. Even if there is a [[Span]]
   * in scope, it may not be used as a Parent [[Span]] if it does not have the proper ids, namely
   * a span id and a trace id. In this case, a new scope with the given name and new ids will be used
   * and it will not have a parent id.
   *
   * If you do not need to have access to the generated [[Span]] used for tracing this operation, this is the best
   * synchronous tracing method to use, as it does not block the current thread in waiting for the [[Span]] to be
   * produced by the in-scope [[ZipkinServiceLike]]
   *
   * Example:
   *
   * {{{
   * TracedOp.simple("sleepy", "boom" -> "shakalaka") {
   *   Thread.sleep(2000.millis.toMillis)
   *   3
   * }
   * }}}
   *
   * @param traceName the name for the span used for tracing
   * @param annotations variable list of annotations to send for tracing in the beginning (after the client sent
   *                    annotation)
   * @param f the function that will take an [A]
